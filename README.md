# Hot Coffee Menu ‚òïÔ∏è

This is a simple web application that displays a menu of hot coffees with their descriptions and ingredients. The app fetches coffee data from an **external** API and allows users to search through the coffee menu by title.

---

## Features

- Displays a list of hot coffees with images, titles, descriptions, and ingredients.
- Allows users to filter coffees by title using a search input.

---

## Technologies Used

- CSS3 (linked externally via `styles.css`)
- JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)
- Fetch API (to retrieve coffee data)

## How It Works

1. The application fetches coffee data from the [Sample Coffee API](https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/hot).
2. The list of coffees is dynamically displayed on the page.
3. Users can search for specific coffees by title, and the displayed list will update accordingly.
